oh-my-zsh-web-plugin
====================

web search plug-in for oh-my-zsh (rough idea, work in progress)

Ideas:
- adding "&& exit" at the end of the xdg-open lines cause terminal window to be replaced (maybe have an option for this?)
- xdg-open needs to be replaced with something platform independent, probably just detect it and set when the plug-in is loaded
- I want to autogenerate these from http://duckduckgo.com/bang.html eventually
